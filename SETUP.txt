Setup Project in Eclipse
==================

1. Install eclipse IDE and the latest version of the Java SDK.
		Note: make sure the SDK and eclipse are the same bit size (e.g. both 64bit).
		
2. Install the following plugins in eclipse: Help -> Install New Software...
	a. Search for "maven" and install m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse (used to build project).
	b. Search for "github" and install Eclipse EGIT Mylyn GitHub Feature (used to clone/push/pull from GitHub.com). Also called Eclipse GitHub integration with task focused interface.
	
3. Import the GitHub project into eclipse.
	a. File -> Import -> Git - > Projects from Git -> GitHub -> [enter project name] -> search
	b. Select the project. It should always start tbaumeist/* if it is from me.
	c. master -> [change destination directory to be where you want to store the project files] -> Import existing projects -> Finish

4. Building the project.
	a. Right click project -> Run As -> Maven build ... -> enter "clean install" in goals -> run. Note: this will kick off a maven build.
	b. To build any time in the future go to the RUN icon and select run configuration we made in set (a).
	Note: can be tricky to get maven to build the first time. If you get the error unable to locate Java compiler, then configure Window->Preferences->Installed JREs and add your SDK (not JRE) folder and set it as the default environment.
	
5. Debugging the project.
	a. Create a new test case in src/test/java
	b. Setup test case to reproduce conditions you desire.
	c. Set break points.
	d. Right click on the class -> Debug As -> JUnit Test
	
6. Updating source code from GitHub (Should be done everytime before working on the project)
	a. Right click project -> Team -> Fetch from Upstream
	
7. Committing changes to GitHub
	a. Make some small change to a file to test a commit if you haven't already.
	b. Right click project -> Team -> Commit..
	c. If config window pops up enter your gitHub username and email address.
	d. Select files to commit.	
	e. Commit and push
	f. If prompts user name and password enter GItHub user name and password.

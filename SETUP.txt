Setup Project in Eclipse
==================

1. Install eclipse IDE and the latest version of the Java SDK.
		Note: make sure the SDK and eclipse are the same bit size (e.g. both 64bit).
		
2. Install the following plugins in eclipse: Help -> Install New Software...
	a. Search for "maven" and install m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse (used to build project).
	b. Search for "github" and install Eclipse EGIT Mylyn GitHub Feature (used to clone/push/pull from GitHub.com). Also called Eclipse GitHub integration with task focused interface.
	
3. Import the GitHub project into eclipse.
	a. File -> Import -> Git - > Projects from Git -> GitHub -> [enter project name] -> search
	b. Select the project. It should always start tbaumeist/* if it is from me.
	c. master -> [change destination directory to be where you want to store the project files] -> Use the New Project Wizard -> Finish
	d. New Project Wizard -> 

4. Build the project.
	Note can be tricky to get maven to build the first time. If you get the error unable to locate Java compiler, then configure Window->Preferences->Installed JREs and add your SDK (not JRE) folder and set it as the default environment.
